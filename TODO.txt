- Filename -> Reading db should not allow duplicates
- Database should be automatically created on first run / if not existant
- Automatically recreate database if folder was modified? Or at least if a non-existent file was encountered

- Check if there is some error handling needed if writing from 2 processes at the same time


- Don't intertwine program logic with chosen database library too much
