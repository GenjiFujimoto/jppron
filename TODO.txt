- Allow defining a sort order
- Allow to filter trailing ã‚ª
- Don't intertwine program logic with chosen database library too much
- Check if there is some error handling needed if writing from 2 processes at the same time

ideas:
- Automatically recreate database if folder was modified? Or at least if a non-existent file was encountered
- Maybe better insert all files into database and then allow specifying the source (e.g. NHK 2016) for a pronunciation
  - Though file size might increase drastically
